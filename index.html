                <h2> Harnoor  Singh  Bajwa</h2>
                <p> I am a second year undergrad student at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia pursuing Bachelor's in 
                    Computer Science. I also work part time as a student navigator providing IT Tech support to students as well
                    as Faculty. I am very keen and excited to learn more about the field of computer science, especially with the 
                    new technologies taking over rapidly, which extremely interests me. I have hands on Java,HTML,CSS and javaScript
                    and exceuting queries using SQL on MySQL and clear understanding of DBMS. I have written multiple reports for various
                    programs involving the working  of a code, background, detailed program description together with results, 
                    conclusion, and future-work. Also, I worked as part of a team in one of the projects where we designed a website for the 
                    restaurant including all the details (about menu , hours and locations, reviews main page , content 
                    etc) using HTML, CSS and basics of JavaScript. Moreover, I am pro-actively involved in multiple 
                    clubs and societies and this tremendous experience has helped me to become an efficient team 
                    player with the ability to lead a group of people. Furthermore, I have learned how to work with 
                    people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. I believe that my coding and problem-solving skills 
                    along with my ready to learn and develop attitude will make me an asset to a team.

                   inheritance and ploymorphism and created UML diagrams describing the relationship between diffrent classes and 
                   different fields and methods(constructors) within those specific classes.</p>
